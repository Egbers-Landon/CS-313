<h1>WELCOME TO MY WEBSITE!</h1>

<?php
?>
<p>My name is Landon Egbers and my favorite way of getting to know people is through a method known as "The FORD method".  FORD is an acronym for Family, Occupation, Recreation, and Dreams.  This website contains those four labels below.  Mousing over each section will reveal a little bit more about who I am.</p>
