<h1>WELCOME TO MY WEBSITE!</h1>

<?php
echo '<i style="color:white;font-size:30px;font-family:calibri ;">
My name is Landon Egbers and my favorite way of getting to know people is through a method known as "The FORD method".  FORD is an acronym for Family, Occupation, Recreation, and Dreams.  This website contains those four labels below.  Mousing over each section will reveal a little bit more about who I am. </i> ';

<div class="row">
  <div class="column" id="one";>
    <h1 id="fam">Family</h1>
    <p class="hidden" id="family">I have a Mother, a father, a sister and 2 brothers.
    We grew up in Fairfax, Virginia (which explains the background).</p>

    <h1 id="occ">Occupation</h1>
    <p class="hidden" id="occupation">I don't currently have a job, but I hope to work
    with HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web design in the very near future.</p>

    <h1 id="rec">Recreation</h1>
    <p class="hidden" id="recreation">I have always had a hard time describing what I like to do for fun,
    but to put it simply, I love competition.  I love any kind of card game, board game, video game, riddle
    or anything where I can win.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column" id="four";>
    <h1 id="dre">Dreams</h1>
    <p class="hidden" id="dream">If money was never an issue for me, I would want to help people who
    struggle with addiction.  If I still had time and money, I would want to open up a scare house.
